                    <h2>About John</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody! My name is John Vehikite, and I was born, raised, 
                        and I currently reside in the Bay Area, CA. I have been married for 
                        eight years (my wife and I were sealed in the Oakland Temple), and 
                        we have two beautiful girls, Zuleyka (6) and Zamira (3). 
                        If you mouse over the picture above, you will see a picture of the
                        lovely ladies in my life!</p>
                    
                    <h3>For more information about John, click the button below:</h3>

                        I am a former BYU-Idaho Pathway student. I am so grateful for that 
                        inspired program! It has allowed me to come back to school after stopping 
                        college more than 10 years ago. I am taking this class because it is a 
                        graduation requirement, but I am excited to improve my PHP skills and to
                        learn additional web technologies.<br><br>My major is Software Engineering, and 
                        I hope to one day work for Google or some other nice software company 
                        (hey, I can dream, right?).<br><br>I work full-time at the financial aid office 
                        at a local community college, and I am also a part-time 
                        <a href="http://johnv.zumba.com">Zumba Instructor</a>. 
                        I will be celebrating my fifth anniversary as a Zumba Instructor this year!
